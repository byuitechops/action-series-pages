<h1>Setup For Course Instructor</h1>
<hr />
<h2>General Setup for Instructor</h2>
<p>Complete the <strong>Instructor Pre-Semester Checklist</strong> that Online Instruction emailed to you. You will receive this email shortly before the semester begins. If you feel you should have received the email but have not yet received it, please contact your Teaching Group Leader (TGL).</p>
<p>Ensure that your Instructor Profile is updated with your Office Hours and other information. To do this, follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on your name in the upper-right corner of I-Learn and then choose "Profile" from the drop-down menu.</li>
<li>Click the Change Picture button and upload your BYU-I professional photo. It must be a small version of it to fit.</li>
<li>Include other information that you would like your students to see. Under "Homepage," enter your Zoom office&nbsp;link. This can be found at <a href="https://byui.zoom.us" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">byui.zoom.us</a> under the profile tab. Under the Contact Information section, be sure to include your phone number and email address. Students can click your image anywhere in the course and it will bring up your profile page. Likewise, you can do the same for students.</li>
<li>Open your course from the Select a Course drop down menu in the top black minibar, and click in Content.&nbsp;Find the&nbsp;Overview page at the very top of the left hand navigation bar and select it. Click on the content of the page to edit it. It will open a content editor window. Here is your instructor contact card. Update this&nbsp;section of the Overview page&nbsp;with your contact information along with other information you'd like your students to see.</li>
